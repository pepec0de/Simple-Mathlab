# Calculator

A simple program that process a string and calculates the operations that are
in the string.

It's standard C++, so it is really easy to build and compatible with others
OSs (multiplatform).

Build the application:<br>
    ~ make

Run the program:<br>
    ~ ./bin/exe

TODO list:<br>
    - Arrow key listener (operations history).<br>
    - <strike>Code the brackets processor</strike>.<br>
    - Implement different number format (like Matlab).<br>
    - Diff function (derivative).<br>
    - Comment all functions.<br>
