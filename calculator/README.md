# Calculator

A simple program that process a string and calculates the operations that are
in the string.

It's standard C++, so it is really easy to build.

Build the application:
    ~ make

Run the program:
    ~ ./bin/exe

TODO list:
    - Arrow key listener (operations history).
    - Code the brackets processor.
    - Implement different number format (like Matlab).
    - Diff function (derivative).
